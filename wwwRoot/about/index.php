						<h1>About Us</h1>
						<p>Children Are Unique Academy was founded in 2017 by Annette Smoote and Sherri Cole, who believe that all children are unique no matter their race, ethnicity or gender. Both women had over 24 years of experience working with children, and so they used their combined skills to form and open their own childcare center. Annette and Sherri wanted to create a place where parents knew their children would be safe and well taken care of. Today, Annette, Sherri, and their team of kind and knowledgeable teachers are fully committed to this top-quality daycare center. They go above and beyond to make sure everything runs smoothly.</p>

								<p>Hello, my name is Annette and I'm one of the co-founders of Children Are Unique Academy. I've worked with children for over 25 years. I have an AAS Degree in Early Care Education and a BA Degree in Human Services. I've worked with all age groups from 6 weeks to 14 years of age, both in daycare and preschools, in the classrooms and also as a supervisor. Working with children is one of my most rewarding experiences. What amazes me most is seeing my old students who still remember me. There isn't anything I would rather do than work with children and their families&mdash;it's my passion!</p>

								<p>Hi, I'm Star and I have a passion for children. I love to watch children explore and learn new things. It's so amazing watching little children grow up. Being able to enjoy them is wonderful, but it is also amazing to assist the parents. These children are my #1 priority and I'll do any and everything in my power to make sure that they are properly cared for and safe. I have 10 years of experience working with children and am looking forward to many more.</p>

I will be finishing my degree at Forest Park Community College and taking Early Care Education classes. I have 6+ years of experience working with children and find it rewarding.

								<p>My name is Jenny, I'm 34 years old, and married with four kids. I went to college to pursue a career in the medical field, up until a year ago when I came to Children Are Unique. I became a teacher to contribute to my community in a meaningful way, and teaching is one of the most direct ways to make an impact. What parents can expect out of my two-year-old class is for me to provide fun learning experiences that encourage their young toddler to explore their environment and interact with peers and teachers. Children in my classroom are introduced to different types of learning experiences based on their individual developmental needs and interests.</p>

								<p>Hello my name is Gloria, and I've been working at Children Are Unique since they opened in March 2018. I enjoy working with the infants and find it to be so much fun. I've really become attached to all of the babies. In my spare time, I like going to the stores just to find something to buy for the little ones.</p>
